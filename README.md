This is more a study, to get a grip on puppeteer and see how my node skeleton app is performing, when building an application upon it. 
It basically makes an instance of Puppeteer, makes browser page, loads a website and tries to scrape images from the given url.

The code comes as is, I give no warranty of correctness and am not responsible for any outcome of usage what so ever, error malfuncions etc..
